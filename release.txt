Sorry there is no (e)mail in the 'mail' part of this add-on. I am a high school
teacher who uses Google Drive for all of my files. Throughout the year I need to
make personalized copies of reminders, passes, and letters for students, which
are hand-delivered in hard-copy form to students. However, to create these
documents I had to resort to Microsoft Office for its simple 'mail merge'
feature. This is a problem for which I have been unsuccessful in finding a free
and easy-to-use add-on, so I wrote my own.

'Simply Mail Merge' takes a template Google Document and inserts data from a
Google Sheets spreadsheet. It can create individual letters (a different record
for each new page or new document) or labels (multple records on the same page).
The label feature is great for creating quarter- or half-sheet sized documents
for students. Simply create and size a table, design your document in a cell of
that table, and copy/paste the contents of that cell to the rest of the table.
Merge fields in each cell of the table will be replaced with a unique record.


FAQ

Q: Why are my documents inside of a table?
A: To speed up the document creation, the content of your template document is
   placed inside of a table with no padding or border. Since tables must have a
   paragraph before and after them (when starting and ending a document) the
   margins of the output document have been slightly shifted to account for the
   space occupied by these small paragraphs.
